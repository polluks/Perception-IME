# Usage

Using Perception-IME at this time is not actually a practical option for anyone...

The current layout and setup is aimed at developers to see that the IME is progressing.
  non-developer users CAN install Perception-IME to see that there is no conflict with existing software.

Additionally It is recommended that you contact me for any specific requests or ideas.

Thank you for actually bothering to read these documents if you have.

Hopefully the instructions are simple enough.
